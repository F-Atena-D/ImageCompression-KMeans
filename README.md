# ImageCompression-KMeans
A MATLAB implementation of image compression using K-means clustering. This project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering for compressing an image by reducing the color palette of the image. This project is useful for understanding the basics of image compression and the application of clustering algorithms in image processing.
